ABSTRACT

Poor posture is a leading cause of musculoskeletal disorders, spinal misalignment, and chronic pain, affecting individuals across all age groups. This project introduces a smart spinal brace that continuously monitors and corrects body posture using a microcontroller, MEMS sensor, temperature sensor, IoT, and LED indicators. The MEMS sensor detects deviations in posture by analyzing the user’s movements and body alignment in real time. If an incorrect posture is detected, the microcontroller processes the data and triggers an immediate response through LED indicators—a green LED for correct posture and a red LED for incorrect posture. This instant feedback mechanism helps users make necessary adjustments to maintain proper alignment. Additionally, the system integrates IoT connectivity, enabling real-time data logging and remote monitoring via a cloud-based platform. Users and healthcare professionals can track posture habits, analyze long-term trends, and receive personalized recommendations for improved spinal health. The temperature sensor ensures user comfort and prevents overheating during prolonged usage.

OBJECTIVES

The objective of spinal braces in controlling body posture is to provide support, stability, and alignment to the spine, thereby helping to prevent or correct poor posture. These braces aim to:

› Correct spinal alignment: By promoting proper alignment, spinal braces help in preventing or managing conditions like scoliosis, kyphosis, and lordosis.

› Support weakened muscles: For individuals with muscle weakness or after surgery, spinal braces assist in maintaining posture by providing extra support.

› Reduce pain: Braces can help alleviate discomfort caused by improper posture, muscle strain, or spinal issues by limiting excessive movement and reducing pressure on sensitive areas.

Overall, spinal braces help improve functional movement and prevent the development of long-term complications associated with poor posture.
